  - description: Users who are not logged in will be redirected to this page when
      they try to visit the home page. This is a simple login form; when the
      user submits the form, it will hit the POST /login endpoint with the email
      and password submitted by the user. If the credentials are valid, the user
      will get an authentication cookie and will be redirected to the Home page.
