# Weather Station
This template provides a complete implementation of the [Losant Walkthrough](https://docs.losant.com/getting-started/walkthrough/). Weather data is periodically requested from an external API and recorded to a [Losant Device](https://docs.losant.com/devices/overview/). The recorded weather data is then presented on your own personal weather dashboard.

## Setup
1. Navigate to your [Application Globals](https://app.losant.com/applications/~exportplaceholderid-application-applicationWeatherStation-0~/globals) and configure the following fields:
	1. `gps_location`: Location (latitude, longitude) that will be used when requesting weather data.
	1. `api_key`: OpenWeatherMap API key. [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) is a separate, paid service, that you sign up for. They provide a free tier, which offers plenty of resources for this application.
2. Enable the [Weather Grabber](https://app.losant.com/applications/~exportplaceholderid-application-applicationWeatherStation-0~/workflows/~exportplaceholderid-flow-weatherGrabber-0~/develop) workflow.

## Weather Grabber Workflow
The [Weather Grabber](https://app.losant.com/applications/~exportplaceholderid-application-applicationWeatherStation-0~/workflows/~exportplaceholderid-flow-weatherGrabber-0~/develop) workflow has a timer that runs every two minutes to request weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It uses the API key and location that you configured above.

## Weather Station Dashboard
The [Weather Station](https://app.losant.com/dashboards/~exportplaceholderid-dashboard-weatherStation-0~) dashboard displays a variety of live and historical weather data. This data is displayed from the [Weather](https://app.losant.com/applications/~exportplaceholderid-application-applicationWeatherStation-0~/devices/~exportplaceholderid-device-weather-0~) device, which is updated by the Weather Grabber workflow.
