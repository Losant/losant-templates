# Losant Templates

This repository contains Losant's collection of [Application Templates](https://docs.losant.com/templates/overview) and [Library Templates](https://docs.losant.com/template-library/overview). These templates are designed to deliver pre-built functionality to accelerate development time and provide implementation guidance and best practices.

For sandbox and enterprise customers of Losant's managed cloud platform, these templates can be found directly in the Losant user interface.

## Application Templates

Application Templates reduce the time it takes to build common types of IoT solutions by providing pre-built foundations on which you can begin developing. These templates provide a set of real-world reference implementations that you can use for:

* Architecture guidance
* Implementation best practices
* Starting points for your own applications

Application templates can be found in the Losant user interface whenever you create a new [Application](https://docs.losant.com/applications/overview/).

## Library Templates

Library Templates provide out-of-the-box functionality that can be imported into any existing Losant application. Each template is self-contained and provides functionality common to many different types of applications (e.g. [Log In Form](https://github.com/Losant/losant-templates/tree/master/library-templates/experiences/forms/log-in) or [QR Code Reader](https://github.com/Losant/losant-templates/tree/master/library-templates/experiences/components/qr-code-reader)).

Library Templates can be found using the `Template Library` navigation link within any existing Losant application.

## How to Import a Template from this Repository
If you're using a dedicated Losant installation or a white-label environment, these templates will not appear in the Losant user interface. If you'd like to use any of these templates, you can import them from this repository:

1. Clone this repository to your local computer.
2. Zip the folder that contains the template you'd like to use.
3. For Application Templates, use Losant's [Application Import](https://docs.losant.com/applications/import-export/#importing-an-application) functionality to import the zipped template as a new application.
4. For Library Templates, use Losant's [Partial Import](https://docs.losant.com/applications/import-export/#import-into-an-existing-application) functionality to import the template into an existing application.
