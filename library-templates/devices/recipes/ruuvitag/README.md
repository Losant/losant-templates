## How to Use a Device Recipe
This template imports a single [Device Recipe](https://docs.losant.com/devices/device-recipes/) into your application. Device recipes allow you to quickly create devices from a predefined set of [Attributes](https://docs.losant.com/devices/attributes/) and [Tags](https://docs.losant.com/devices/overview/#device-tags). Device recipes can be used to create a single device, or used to [create many](https://docs.losant.com/devices/device-recipes/#bulk-device-creation) devices at once.

The `RuuviTag` device recipe contains all of the recommended attributes and tags when utilizing the RuuviTag sensor within the Losant platform.
