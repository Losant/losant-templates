## About the KST3320 Distance Sensor

> The KST3320, our LoRaWAN Distance Sensor, is a patent pending device capable of contact-less measurement of solid and liquid levels within 10mm accuracy. It is capable of transmitting that information over short ranges using Bluetooth Low Energy or long range using a variety of Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). 

> Since the KST3320 is powered by our flexible Unity V4 Engine (KST1120), we are able to offer customization services to meet your particular data or transmission needs. And since the device is generally capable of measuring virtually any object within this accuracy and up to 2-meters away, the KST3320 is an ideal sensor choice for a variety of Internet-of-Things applications.
