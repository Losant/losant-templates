## About Aruba Meridian

> Aruba’s new asset tracking solution can help you quickly locate business critical devices or inventory — like wheelchairs or pallets of retail goods — saving you valuable time and money. Using BLE-enabled Aruba Tags with your location-ready Aruba wireless network, deployment is fast and easy. 

> Your location-ready Aruba wireless network delivers more value with its integrated Bluetooth beacons and radios. This means that BLE-enabled Aruba APs can be a beacon for mobile engagement or a reader for asset tracking. Learn how to leverage your Aruba APs in new ways.

## How to Use a Device Recipe
This template imports a single [Device Recipe](https://docs.losant.com/devices/device-recipes/) into your application. Device recipes allow you to quickly create devices from a predefined set of [Attributes](https://docs.losant.com/devices/attributes/) and [Tags](https://docs.losant.com/devices/overview/#device-tags). Device recipes can be used to create a single device, or used to [create many](https://docs.losant.com/devices/device-recipes/#bulk-device-creation) devices at once.

The `Aruba Meridian Asset Tag` device recipe contains all of the recommended attributes and tags when utilizing the Aruba Meridian sensors and service within the Losant platform.
